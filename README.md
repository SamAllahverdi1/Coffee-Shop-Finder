## üìñ About The Project

Welcome to the Atlanta Coffee Shop Finder! This web application was developed as a final project for the Georgia Tech **CS 2340: Objects and Design** course. Our team of four created this platform to help Atlanta locals and visitors discover and share their favorite coffee spots around the city.

The application's core feature is an interactive map that displays local coffee shops, allowing users to easily find a cafe near them. Users can also view shops in a list, save their favorites, and contribute to the community by leaving ratings and reviews.
